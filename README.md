<h1>Steam Library Manager</h1>
<p>is a tool to manage your Steam, Origin and Uplay Libraries quick and easy. With SLM you can administrate all of your games and backups from one place. Drag and drop between libraries and backup folders with ease. Works with existing Steam Backups or opt to use SLM's open system for fast updates and quick access to game files.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits to using SLM over Steam Backup:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Backups can be updated quickly. No need to recreate the entire backup from scratch.</li>
    <li>Backup files are open and easily accessible.</li>
    <li>Workshop content and mods such as ENB, ReShade, and SweetFX get backed up automatically.</li>
    <li>Faster backups, faster restores, works with or without the Clients running.</li>
    <li>Compression is available for those who want to keep things lean.</li>
    <li>Built-in library cleaner for leftovers.</li>
    <li>Compact both backups and installed games for even more hard disk space.</li>
</ul>
<p>SLM is licensed under MIT license which means it is completely free and open source!</p>
<p>All suggestions are welcome and will help further development of SLM.</p>
